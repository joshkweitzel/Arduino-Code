All of these projects were built using the Arduino IDE.
Most of the projects will required an occampanying circuit with various components plugged into the Arduino.
Essential Components used:
- Arduino Uno
- 128 x 64 OLED Display, using the I2C protocol
- Momentary Tactile Push Button Switch
- 10Kohm resistor
